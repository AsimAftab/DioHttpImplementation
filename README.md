# **DioHttp Implementation with FLask(Python) in Dart**

This project demonstrates how to use DioHttp in Dart to make API calls to a Flask server written in Python. It covers various endpoints for tasks like user creation, fetching users, etc.

## **Introduction**
DioHttp is a Dart HTTP client library that simplifies making HTTP requests. This project illustrates how to utilize DioHttp to communicate with a Flask server in Python. It includes examples of creating users, fetching user data, and more.
  
## **Dependencies**
* Dio: DioHttp library for Dart (add to your pubspec.yaml).
* Flask: Python web framework for creating the server.
## **Getting Started**
* Clone the Repository: Clone this repository and the Flask server repository(https://github.com/AsimAftab/Backend).
* Run the Flask Server: Navigate to the Flask server directory and run the server.
* Run the Dart Project:Open your Dart project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code). Ensure you have DioHttp added as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml. Run the Dart project, which will communicate with the Flask server.
